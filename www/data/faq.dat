FAQ:What is EPM?

<p>EPM is the software packaging tool that we now use at Easy
Software Products. It is a simple tool that generates software
and patch distributions in various formats, including:</p>

<ul>

	<li>AIX Software Packages ("installp").</li>

	<li>BSD Software Packages ("pkg_add"), used by FreeBSD,
	NetBSD, and OpenBSD.</li>

	<li>AT&T Software Packages ("pkgadd"), used by
	Solaris.</li>

	<li>Compaq Tru64 UNIX ("setld")</li>

	<li>Debian Package Manager ("dpkg")</li>

	<li>HP-UX Software Packages ("swinstall")</li>

	<li>IRIX Software Manager ("inst")</li>

	<li>MacOS X Software Packages ("name.pkg" and "name.mpkg")</li>

	<li>Portable (installation and removal scripts with tar
	files)</li>

	<li>Red Hat Package Manager ("rpm")</li>

	<li>Slackware Software Packages ("name.tgz")</li>

</ul>

<p>EPM also includes a graphical "setup" program that can be
provided with your distributions to make installation of more
than one package a snap.</p>


FAQ:Why Another Software Packaging Tool?

<p>We developed EPM because we were tired of developing and
testing N different software distributions, each with their own
input files and setup requirements.</p>

<p>Also, when we started looking at selling software for Linux
we saw that there are at least four different "standard"
distribution formats, and none of them are compatible with the
other. Clearly we needed something that could be used for all
platforms, <i>without</i> requiring special software packages on
the customer's system!</p>

<p>The EPM manual, <a href='documentation.php'>"Software
Distribution with the ESP Package Manager"</a>, goes into
greater depth on our reasoning.</p>


FAQ:Do I Have to Pay to Distribute Software Using EPM?

<p>No! EPM is free software and any installations you create are
unencumbered by licensing of any kind, not even the GPL.</p>


FAQ:How Do I Report Problems and Submit Patches?

<p>You can report bugs and submit all patches to the <a
href='../espnews.php?gepm.bugs'>epm.bugs</a> newsgroup.</p>


FAQ:What Features are Planned for EPM 5.x?

<p>EPM 5.x will add numerous new features, including:

<ul>

	<li>GUI list file editor [partially implemented]</li>

	<li>Relocatable packages</li>

	<li>Build-from-source (%build instructions)</li>

	<li>Support for libtool</li>

	<li>Better manpage installation support -
	specifically, add code to automatically locate the
	correct man directory for each file depending on the
	architecture</li>

	<li>Support for dependency checking against vendor
	packages; that is, a portable package could check its
	dependencies against portable, RPM, Debian, etc.
	packages, rather than just packages of the same format</li>

	<li>Support for checksums, probably using the "sum"
	command or something else suitably portable, to
	verify the tar files and installed files</li>

</ul>

<p>You can access the current 5.x development code via <a
href='svn.php#development'>Subversion</a>.</p>


SECTION:Compiling Questions

FAQ:What is Required for EPM?

<p>On your development system you just need a C compiler, a make
program, the Bourne (or Korn or Bash) shell, and gzip.</p>

<p>The graphical setup program needs a C++ compiler and version
1.1 of the FLTK library, available at "<a
href='http://www.fltk.org/'>http://www.fltk.org/</a>".</p>

<p>EPM can generate so-called "portable" distributions that are
based on shell scripts and tar files. For these types of
distributions your customers/users will need the Bourne (or Korn
or Bash) shell, a tar program, and GNU zip. The first two are
standard items, and GNU zip is being shipped by most vendors as
well.</p>

<p>EPM can also generate vendor-specific distributions.  These
require the particular vendor tool (rpm, dpkg, etc.) to create
and install the software package.</p>


FAQ:How Do I Compile EPM?

<p>EPM uses GNU autoconf to configure itself for your system. 
To build it, use:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>./configure ENTER</kbd>
<kbd>make ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Once EPM is compiled you can type:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>su ENTER</kbd>
<kbd>make install ENTER</kbd>
</pre>

<p>to install the software in /usr/bin.</p>
