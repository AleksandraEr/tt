TODO - ESP Package Manager (EPM) 5.0
------------------------------------

	- "%relocatable /prefix" to enable relocatable packages,
	  and wrap(/lib/path) to flag executables that need to have a
	  shell wrapper for shared libraries and the installation
	  directory passed in...
	- Add /opt relocation hack and allow for relocatable and
	  non-root packages in general.
	- %option to pass in format-specific command-line options
	  to the packaging program.
	- %category to set the application category (RPM, Debian,
	  AT&T PKG, etc.)
	- Add noauto() option to init script files to disable
	  auto start/stop of software.
	- Do portable config file stuff for formats that don't
	  support config files (HP-UX + others)
	- Use dpkg-shlibdeps when generating Debian packages.
	- "epm --build ..." to build software from source and
	  make a distribution
	- "%build foo" for build instructions
	- Look for .list and .list.in; reload if building and
	  filename == .list.in.
	- Add support for executables and libraries created with
	  libtool.
	- Add a small script that can be installed with every
	  portable software package to list and remove installed
	  packages.
	- Add better manpage installation support -
	  specifically, add code to automatically locate the
	  correct man directory for each file depending on the
	  architecture.
	- Add support for dependency checking against vendor
	  packages; that is, a portable package could check its
	  dependencies against portable, RPM, Debian, etc.
	  packages, rather than just packages of the same
	  format.
	- Add support for checksums (probably just "sum"
	  command) to verify the tar files and installed files.
	- Support for RPM features:
		- Icon: filename.xpm/gif
		- Serial: #
		- %post: detect upgrades via $1 > 1
